# LOVE SANDWISH
This Python program automates the process of managing sales, stock, and surplus data for a sandwich store by integrating with Google Sheets. The system allows the user to input sales data, automatically calculates surplus (which represents the difference between stock and sales), and updates the relevant Google Sheets accordingly. Additionally, the program computes future stock needs based on the last five entries of sales data, accounting for a 10% buffer in stock calculations.
